![SQL Assistant Header](https://miro.medium.com/v2/resize:fit:720/format:webp/1*71lI66X4-4nxkKWVhrTW_A.png) 


This repository demonstrates how to build a conversational SQL Query Assistant using LangChain's `create_sql_agent`. The assistant connects to a PostgreSQL database and dynamically generates SQL queries based on natural language inputs. It leverages the power of OpenAI's GPT models and LangChain's memory and prompt engineering capabilities to optimize and execute queries, making it a robust tool for exploring and analyzing data.

### Features

- **Natural Language Interface**: Users can ask complex SQL-related questions without needing prior SQL expertise.
- **Dynamic Query Generation**: The assistant analyzes user inputs to generate precise, efficient, and actionable SQL queries.
- **PostgreSQL Integration**: Seamlessly integrates with a PostgreSQL database using SQLAlchemy.
- **Memory Management**: Includes conversational memory to maintain context and history across queries.
- **Optimization Focused**: Ensures performance and accuracy in query design for complex data relationships.
